Not Enough Wooden Items (or NEWI) is a Fabric mod that focus on adding more wooden tools and weapons to the game, which are better than the already existent ones. Currently, this mod adds 6 new tools and weapons tiers, in order from the least powerful to the most powerful:
- Birch
- Spruce
- Jungle
- Acacia
- Dark Oak
- Mangrove

Each tier gives more advantages than the one before

With all that, this mod can be a great addition to your survival adventures, and can help a lot for early game!
